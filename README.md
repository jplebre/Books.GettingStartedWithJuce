# Books.GettingStartedWithJuce
Updated project folder with exercises from "Getting Started With JUCE" using JUCE 4.0

There's a folder that includes all JUCE modules and the ProJucer application.
Solution built with XCode, but should work with any other IDE that can handle C++11.

There's a few exercises missing from the end of the book, maybe I'll get around to add those at some point.
